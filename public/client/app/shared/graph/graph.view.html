<h1>Total Percentages of Dreams and Nightmares to Date</h1>

<!-- This allows our directive on the graph controller to render the d3 to the graph view. 
	The night-mare count is referring to $scope.nightmareCount on the graph controller
	The dream-count is referring to $scope.dreamCount on the graph controller
	By doing it this way, gives our directives access to updated data -->
